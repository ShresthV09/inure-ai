A chat-style copilot puts tribal knowledge on tap, sitting on top of your data lake. Ask, 'Which SKUs caused 80% of delayed deliveries last quarter?' and get an answer in seconds rather than after a week-long spreadsheet hunt. Each load leaves the yard with a stamped CO₂ figure, making carbon math automatic. Finance teams drop those numbers straight into EU-ETS or customer scorecards, side-stepping manual calculations and reputational risk."
